	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a critical concept in computer science that measures how the computational time of an algorithm grows relative to the size of its input. It helps in evaluating how efficient an algorithm is in terms of execution time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to its input size. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) requires memory that grows linearly with the input size.
